# LLM
🚀 Welcome to the LLM Reference Repository! 🌟  Your one-stop hub for mastering Large Language Models (LLMs). Discover diverse prompting techniques, fine-tuning tips, and best practices for optimizing LLMs. Perfect for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts aiming to harness the full potential of LLMs. Let's innovate together! 💡📚


## Library & tools for developers.

1. [aisuite](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite) - Simple, unified interface to multiple Generative AI providers.
2. [micro-agent](https://github.com/BuilderIO/micro-agent) - An AI agent that writes and fixes code for you.
3. [Parler-TTS 🗣️](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts) - ParlerTTS is a training and inference library for high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) models.
4. [Colpali llama vision rag](https://github.com/kturung/colpali-llama-vision-rag) -A powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combining Colpali's ColQwen image embeddings with LLaMA Vision via Ollama.
5. [annotateai](https://github.com/neuml/annotateai) --annotateai automatically annotates papers using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs can summarize papers, search papers and build generative text about papers, this project focuses on providing human readers with context as they read.
6. [Agentarium](https://github.com/Thytu/Agentarium) -- A powerful Python framework for managing and orchestrating AI agents with ease. Agentarium provides a flexible and intuitive way to create, manage, and coordinate interactions between multiple AI agents in various environments.
